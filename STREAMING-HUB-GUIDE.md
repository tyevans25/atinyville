## 📢 Editing Campaign Updates (Carousel)

Find this section at the top of the file (around line 10):

```typescript
const campaignUpdates = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "🎵 Pre-Save New Album",
    description: "Pre-save the upcoming album on Spotify & Apple Music!",
    link: "https://orcd.co/ateez", // ← Change this to your actual link
    platform: "Spotify & Apple Music",
    urgent: true  // ← Set to true for urgent campaigns (shows red badge)
  },
  // ... more campaigns
]
```

### Adding a New Campaign:

```typescript
{
  id: 5,  // Increment this number
  title: "🎤 Vote on Music Shows",
  description: "Vote for ATEEZ on Mnet, SBS, KBS!",
  link: "https://yourlink.com",
  platform: "Music Shows",
  urgent: true  // Show URGENT badge
}
```

### Tips:
- Use emojis in titles for visual appeal
- Set `urgent: true` for time-sensitive campaigns
- Keep descriptions short (1-2 sentences)
- Update links regularly

## 📅 Editing the Events Calendar

Find this section (around line 40):

```typescript
const upcomingEvents = [
  {
    id: 1,
    date: "2026-02-01",  // ← Format: YYYY-MM-DD
    title: "Album Release",
    description: "New album drops!",
    type: "release"  // Can be: release, performance, concert, etc.
  },
  // ... more events
]
```

### Adding a New Event:

```typescript
{
  id: 4,
  date: "2026-04-15",
  title: "Fan Meeting",
  description: "Online fan meeting at 8PM KST",
  type: "fanmeeting"
}
```

### The calendar will automatically:
- Calculate "days until" countdown
- Sort events chronologically
- Show date in a nice format

## ⚡ Editing Quick Action Buttons

Find the Quick Actions section (around line 250 in the return statement).

### Changing a Button:

```typescript
<Button 
  className="w-full justify-start bg-green-100 text-green-700 hover:bg-green-200"
  variant="outline"
  onClick={() => window.open('YOUR_LINK_HERE', '_blank')}
>
  <Music className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
  Your Button Text
</Button>
```

### Adding a New Button:

Just copy one of the existing buttons and change:
1. The colors (`bg-green-100`, `text-green-700`, etc.)
2. The link in `window.open()`
3. The icon and text

**Available colors:**
- Green: `bg-green-100 text-green-700`
- Red: `bg-red-100 text-red-700`
- Blue: `bg-blue-100 text-blue-700`
- Purple: `bg-purple-100 text-purple-700`
- Orange: `bg-orange-100 text-orange-700`
- Pink: `bg-pink-100 text-pink-700`

## 🎨 Changing Colors & Styling

### Gradient Background:
Find this line (around line 17):
```typescript
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-600 via-purple-700 to-indigo-800">
```

Change colors:
- `from-purple-600` → starting color
- `via-purple-700` → middle color
- `to-indigo-800` → ending color

**Available gradient colors:** 
red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, purple, pink, rose, teal, cyan

**Intensities:** 
100 (lightest) to 900 (darkest)

### Card Header Colors:
```typescript
// Carousel header
className="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-indigo-600"

// Calendar header
className="bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-600 to-purple-600"

// Quick Actions header
className="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-pink-600"
```

---

## 🔄 Carousel Settings

### Change Auto-Advance Speed:

Find this (around line 20):
```typescript
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  setCurrentSlide((prev) => (prev + 1) % campaignUpdates.length)
}, 5000) // ← Change this number (milliseconds)
```

- `3000` = 3 seconds
- `5000` = 5 seconds (default)
- `10000` = 10 seconds

### Disable Auto-Advance:

Comment out the entire useEffect block:
```typescript
/*
useEffect(() => {
  // ... carousel code
}, [])
*/
```

## 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

The hub automatically adapts to mobile! But you can test it:

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` on your phone (same WiFi)
3. Or in browser: Press F12 → Click phone icon → Select a device

---

## 🚀 Testing Your Changes

1. Edit `app/page.tsx`
2. Save (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
3. Refresh your browser
4. Check that:
   - All links work
   - Dates are correct
   - Carousel advances properly
   - Mobile layout looks good

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Keep campaigns fresh:**
- Update carousel weekly with new campaigns
- Remove old/expired campaigns
- Mark time-sensitive ones as `urgent: true`

**Calendar management:**
- Add events as soon as they're announced
- Include ticket sale dates
- Add timezone info in descriptions (e.g., "8PM KST")

**Link shortening:**
- Use bit.ly or similar to track clicks
- Easier to update if links change
- Looks cleaner in tweets

**Visual hierarchy:**
- Put most urgent campaign first in carousel
- Keep 3-5 campaigns max (too many = overwhelming)
- Order events chronologically (code does this automatically)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Carousel not advancing:**
- Check console for errors (F12)
- Make sure all campaigns have unique IDs

**Calendar dates wrong:**
- Use format `YYYY-MM-DD` exactly
- Example: `"2026-03-15"` not `"3/15/2026"`

**Links not working:**
- Test each link in a new tab first
- Use full URLs with `https://`

**Changes not showing:**
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear browser cache
- Check that you saved the file
